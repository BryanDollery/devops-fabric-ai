# Devops and Software Engineering patterns

These patterns have been carefully created by a senior engineer to help in his own day to day work. They all setup a context of being a very senior engineer with great communication skills, and they expect you to be the same.

# Aliases
Some aliases have been created to help out on the command line - they do not read their stdin.

* alias research="fabric -sp devops/research --text"
* alias script="fabric -sp devops/create_bash_script --text"
* alias shortcuts="fabric -sp devops/find_keyboard_shortcuts --text"
* alias tools="fabric -sp devops/improve_tool --text"
* alias bug="fabric -sp devops/solve_problem --text"
* alias install="fabric -sp devops/install --text"

## Usage Example

```
$ research "hyprland rpi5"
```
