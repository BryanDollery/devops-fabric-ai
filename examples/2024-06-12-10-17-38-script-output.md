## Manager
Alright team, we have a new task from the owner. The requirement is to install Hyprland on an RPi5. Let's get started.

## Manager -> Analyst
Please break down the requirement into user stories and identify any dependencies.

## Analyst
Got it. I'll start by researching Hyprland and its installation process on an RPi5.

## Analyst -> Web
Search: "Hyprland installation on Raspberry Pi 5"

## Analyst -> Web
Search: "Hyprland requirements"

## Analyst -> Web
Search: "Hyprland official documentation"

## Analyst
Based on my research, Hyprland is a dynamic tiling Wayland compositor that requires specific dependencies and configurations. Installing it on an RPi5 might involve several steps, including setting up the necessary environment, installing dependencies, and configuring the system.

### User Stories:
1. **Environment Setup**
   - **Definition**: As a user, I want to set up the necessary environment for Hyprland on my RPi5 so that I can proceed with the installation.
   - **Acceptance Criteria**:
     - Given a fresh RPi5 setup, when the script is run, then it should prepare the environment by updating the system and installing necessary tools like Docker.

2. **Install Dependencies**
   - **Definition**: As a user, I want to install all dependencies required by Hyprland on my RPi5 so that the installation can proceed smoothly.
   - **Acceptance Criteria**:
     - Given the prepared environment, when the script is run, then it should install all necessary dependencies for Hyprland.

3. **Build and Install Hyprland**
   - **Definition**: As a user, I want to build and install Hyprland on my RPi5 so that I can use it as my window manager.
   - **Acceptance Criteria**:
     - Given all dependencies are installed, when the script is run, then it should build and install Hyprland successfully.

4. **Configuration**
   - **Definition**: As a user, I want to configure Hyprland on my RPi5 so that it runs correctly with my setup.
   - **Acceptance Criteria**:
     - Given Hyprland is installed, when the script is run, then it should configure Hyprland with default settings suitable for an RPi5.

### Dependencies:
- Story 2 depends on Story 1.
- Story 3 depends on Story 2.
